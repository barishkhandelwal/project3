        <b>Virtual Labs</b> is a project 
        initiated by the
            Ministry of Human Resource 
        Development, Government of India, under the National 
        Mission on Education through Information and Communication Technology.<br />
        <br />
        The project aims to provide 
        remote-access to Laboratories in various disciplines of science and engineering 
        for students at all levels from under-graduate to research.
        It also intends to develop a complete Learning Management System where the 
        students can avail the various tools for learning, including additional 
        web-resources, video-lectures, animated demonstrations and self-evaluation. 
        There is also a component wherein costly equipment and resources are shared, 
        which are otherwise available to only a limited number of users due to 
        constraints on time and geographical distances.<br />
        <br />
        Seven IIT's (Delhi,Bombay,Kanpur,Kharagpur,Madras,Roorkee, Guwahati),IIIT Hyderabad,Amrita University,Dayalbagh University,NIT Karnataka, and College of Engineering, Pune, are 
        the institutions participating in the project.The Project intends to cover physical sciences, chemical science and various 
        branches of engineering like electronics and communications, computer science 
        and engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, chemical 
        engineering, biotechnology engineering and civil engineering.
